# Django Spages

Lightweight single page app for Django using only Jquery and [Page.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/page.js) (7.8 Ko). 

- Fast: load the page once and update the content using rest
- Easy: no 

## Install

``pip install djangorestframework``

Clone this repo and migrate.

Installed apps:

  ```python
`"rest_framework",`
`"spages",`
  ```

Urls: add `urlpatterns.append(url(r'^',include('spages.urls')))` at the end of urls.py

## Usage

Create pages in the admin. The page.js routes will be autogenerated in ``templates/spages/auto/routes.js``. A management
command is also available to rebuild the routes: ``python manage.py build_routes``. Just link to your pages normaly
in the navigation and the routes will be applied, retrieving rest content from the server to serve pages.
